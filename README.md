_**This repository is superseeded now by [QUniBone](https://github.com/j-hoppe/QUniBone) and should be considered "freezed".**_

"UniBone" is a Linux-to-UNIBUS bridge, implemented with a BeagleBone Black micro Linux system.

UniBone can keep old PDP-11s running, by emulating devices and aiding in repair.
